Basically, we cant use this entrance after five oclock.&&FOCUS&&focus
Fortunately, she has decided to help us.&&FOCUS&&focus
Generally, we have little rain in summer in Perth.&&FOCUS&&focus
Apparently, theyve run out of tickets for the show.&&FOCUS&&focus
Happily, he did not die.&&FOCUS&&focus
It's obvious that he's mistaken.&&FOCUS&&focus
It is impossible that it can be so.&&FOCUS&&focus
It's impossible that he's busy.&&FOCUS&&focus
It's so hard that you can't get your teeth into it.&&FOCUS&&focus
It is clear that he is innocent.&&FOCUS&&focus
It is good that I asked you that.&&FOCUS&&focus
It is true that he is ill.&&FOCUS&&focus
It is odd that he is so late.&&FOCUS&&focus
The reason I love my mom is because she is very understanding.&&FOCUS&&focus
The place we went on our date is Central Park.&&FOCUS&&focus

Why he wrote that song is something only his sister knows.&&FOCUS&&focus
Why they left me alone is a mystery.&&FOCUS&&focus
Where she had some remained to be unanswered.&&FOCUS&&focus
How he recruited her is something he should tell us.&&FOCUS&&focus
How he climbed the mountain is something everyone wants to know about.&&FOCUS&&focus
Where she is right now is something to ask over the phone.&&FOCUS&&focus
How he succeeded in business is something I would like to know.&&FOCUS&&focus
How he managed to cook all this is a mystery.&&FOCUS&&focus

The general point is that you must ask for permission first.&&FOCUS&&focus
The exhausting thing is that I have homework to do after this.&&FOCUS&&focus
The growing problem is that unemployment is worsening among young people.&&FOCUS&&focus
The fascinating fact is that she has seven brothers.&&FOCUS&&focus
The interesting thing is that she recently started dancing.&&FOCUS&&focus
The sad thing is that I need to leave town in two days.&&FOCUS&&focus
The real reason is that he just ran out of money.&&FOCUS&&focus

At least, last I heard, she is moving to Yemen next month.&&FOCUS&&focus
In addition, just so you know, I will be giving a speech next week.&&FOCUS&&focus
At least, in my opinion, your performance was the best.&&FOCUS&&focus
All of a sudden, out of the blue, a man jumped out of the car.&&FOCUS&&focus
As a result, in addition to my sister, my mom also had to call a taxi.&&FOCUS&&focus
What is more, from my point of view, she is the one that's in the wrong.&&FOCUS&&focus
On the other hand, for example, the students were moved to a new campus.&&FOCUS&&focus
What is more, once in a while, I go to the swimming pool with her.&&FOCUS&&focus
In addition, to the best of my knowledge, the teacher will talk about the final exam.&&FOCUS&&focus
That therapy isn't there to help you&&NEGATION&&negation
Life is not perfectly fair.&&NEGATION&&negation
Her situation isn't that uncommon.&&NEGATION&&negation

I would not mind telling you the truth.&&NEGATION&&negation
I could not come home on time.&&NEGATION&&negation
We won't do it either, will we?&&NEGATION&&negation
They cannot open the window by any means.&&NEGATION&&negation
We shall not start another business.&&NEGATION&&negation
I would not mind listening to the sound.&&NEGATION&&negation

Please do not bring anything to the class.&&NEGATION&&negation
I purchased some shoes because I have not got any.&&NEGATION&&negation
Charlie asked me if I got a water bottle and I answered I did not get any.&&NEGATION&&negation
They asked me how many friends I have and I said that I did not have many.&&NEGATION&&negation

Charlie did not get much money there.&&NEGATION&&negation
He did not need to bring any bills.&&NEGATION&&negation
I am wondering why she did not take much water when she could.&&NEGATION&&negation
How can you not find any clue from this?&&NEGATION&&negation
We wanted to prove that there are not many things we cannot accomplish together.&&NEGATION&&negation

Nothing is ever right.&&NEGATION&&negation
You'll never know unless you try.&&NEGATION&&negation
We don't have it in stock yet.&&NEGATION&&negation
There is still no reply.&&NEGATION&&negation
